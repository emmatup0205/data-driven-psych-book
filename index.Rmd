# Data-Driven Insights in Psychology: Reproducible Analyses Using R

This book is a compilation of data analyses completed as part of **PSYC. 7750G Reproducible Psychological Research, Fall 2025**.  
It integrates multiple assignments exploring real-world datasets, including NYC open data, survey data on streaming preferences, and wage outcomes, using R for data cleaning, visualization, and statistical modeling.  

The goal is to demonstrate **reproducible research practices**, from data wrangling to interpretation, while building skills in statistical reasoning, visualization, and reporting.  
Each chapter provides context, methods, and clear explanations to allow readers to follow and replicate the analyses independently.
